simplify daily/periodic key file management

I wrote this bat file to prevent having to rename _key.ppk_ every day/multiple times daily.  you may have a different type of file that needs the same treatment, my solution is to move the file from downloads to the program directory, overwriting in the program directory and leaving nothing that needs overwritten or key(2), key_2, etc to have to deal with manually.

I made it purposely simple so that it can be easily tweaked for additional similar usage, the main & cleanup sections are fairly straightforward and as I don't work with bat/ps daily they also serve as a guide or reminder for myself.
